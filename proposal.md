## Game Elements
The game will involve 1 board, 2 players, 64 standard tiles, 128 player tiles, and an interface that will run the game on an internet browser.

### Tiles
The 64 distinct standard tiles will be broken up into 3 categories, each featuring 4 subcategories, which will span across the categories (4 to the power of 3 will yield 64). The three categories will be color, shape, and number. Color's subcategories will be red, blue, yellow, and green. Shape's subcategories will be triangle, square, hexagon, and circle. Number's subcategories will be 1, 2, 3, and 4. As a result, there will be 16 red tiles, 16 triangle tiles, etc. For example, the 16 red tiles will include 4 triangles numbered 1 to 4, along with 4 circles numbered 1 to 4, etc.

In addition to the standard tiles, there are 128 non-distinct player tiles. Each player will only have one style of tile, and it will be used to indicate that they have won a particular cell on the board. There are only 128 of them in order to account for the possibility that 1 player may capture all 64 of the board's cells. However, the 128 number is only to account for an analog physical game set (or a hardcoded game); in practice, there will only be 2 pieces, stored as 2 elements in the code.
