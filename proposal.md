INTRO TEXT TK

## Game Elements
The game will involve 1 board, 2 players, 64 tiles, and an interface that will run the game on an internet browser.

### Tiles
The 64 tiles will be broken up into 3 categories, each featuring 4 subcategories, which will span across the categories (4 to the power of 3 will yield 64). The three categories will be color, shape, and number. Color's subcategories will be red, blue, yellow, and green. Shape's subcategories will be triangle, square, hexagon, and circle. Number's subcategories will be 1, 2, 3, and 4. As a result, there will be 16 red tiles, 16 triangle tiles, etc. For example, the 16 red tiles will include 4 triangles numbered 1 to 4, along with 4 circles numbered 1 to 4, etc.
